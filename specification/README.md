## HAProxy Data Plane API Specification

This is the [OpenAPI 2.0 (fka Swagger)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) specification for the [HAProxy Data Plane API project](https://github.com/theunknownport/dataplaneapi)

## Contributing

When contributing, change files located in paths/ and models/ directories and the haproxy-spec.yaml, and then build the resulting one-file spec `build/haproxy_spec.yaml`.

```bash
go run specification/build/build.go -file specification/haproxy-spec.yaml > specification/build/haproxy_spec.yaml
```

this is already integrated into [make models](../Makefile) command

For commit messages and general style please follow the haproxy project's [CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING) and use that where applicable.
